## Year-end projects 

The final project for this course consist in a reproducibility challenge. You are asked to reproduce one or two plots from a published paper in machine learning. 




# Notes:

*  Project will account for 40% of the final grade. You may work in teams of 2-4 people. There will be a limited number of project to choose from, and you will not be able to chose other projects. Each team member's contribution should be highlighted. You should use the project as an opportunity to "learn by doing".

* *Written Report:*  You will write a maximum 4 page PDF report on your findings, using LaTeX. We also welcome a jointed jupyter notebook.   Please make sure to take into account the following consideration.
a) Reproducibility: Your classmates should be able to reproduce your results based on your report only. Describe what preprocessing is required, what hyper-parameter values you selected and why, and clearly describe the overall pipeline you used. b) Code :Try to make your code as readable as possible. c) Clarity: Explain clearly what you are trying to do. d) Critical thinking: If you do not reproduce similar results as in the original paper,  be critical of your approach, of (perhaps) of the onbe in the paper. 

* A latex template that could be use for your report is given [here](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/latex-example-paper) 



* We are definitly aware that not all tasks have the same difficulty. We will take the difficulty of the question into account when grading, so none of the choices will have any disadvantage for you.
